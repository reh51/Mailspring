New to Mailspring. During setup, I was presented and then clicked a folder-related option. Now, ALL imported folders have the word 'folders' before each individual folder. I would like to adjust that setting, somewhere, and, across the board, remove that BUT cannot find anywhere how to do so. Thank you
